- @dunn2018generalized is a recent textbook on GLMs. It doesn't cover time-to-event models, and it doesn't use the modern [`tidyverse`](https://tidyverse.org/) packages ([`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), etc.), but otherwise it seems great.

- @moore2016applied is a recent textbook on survival analysis. It also doesn't use the `tidyverse`, but otherwise seems great.

- @rms2e is another popular textbook. It uses [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) but not [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), 
and covers GLMs and survival analysis. 
An abbreviated but continuously updated version with audio clips is available at <https://hbiostat.org/rmsc/>.

- @fox2015applied is another standard text.

- @mccullaghnelder is a classic, theoretical textbook on GLMs

- @dalgaardintroductory covers GLMs and survival analysis at an applied level, using base R

- @vittinghoff2e covers GLMs, survival analysis, and causal inference, using Stata

- @faraway2016extending has GLMs but not survival analysis

- @selvin2001epidemiologic provides worked-out examples of applications for a wide range of 
statistical analysis techniques.

- <https://ucla-biostat-200c-2020spring.github.io/schedule/schedule.html> provides course notes for 
"Biostat 200C - Methods in Biostatistics C" at UCLA, which is at the Biostatistics MS level.

- <https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat504/book/> provides course notes for 
"STAT 504 - Analysis of Discrete Data" at Penn State University. 
It includes logistic regression and Poisson regression, as well as 2-way tables and other related topics, and includes SAS code.

- @NahhasIRMPHR is currently in-development
