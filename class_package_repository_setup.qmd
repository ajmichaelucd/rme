# Getting Started

## Updating R

Is your R up to date? Let's find out. Pull up R and run:
`getRversion()`. You should get something like this:

```{r}
getRversion()
```

If your version started with a three, it's definitely time for an
update, depending on your OS we probably want to be running 4.2.x or
4.3.x. My Mac is still running 10.15, so I'm using 4.2.3 at the moment.

You can also navigate to the terminal window in RStudio or open a
terminal window and type `R --version`. If you just wondered what
RStudio is, let's get that set up next

## RStudio

If you haven't used RStudio before, it's a very helpful Integrated
Development Environment (IDE) that we can use to run R with much more
information visible to us and can make navigation, version control, and
other tasks much easier and quicker.

If you don't have it, navigate to this site to download it:
<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

![RStudio
Example](images/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-26%20at%2012.45.15%20AM.png){fig-alt="Remaining text in this section should cover everything in this image"}

In the top left, we have a place to edit our scripts, here we can write
code then run it after.

In the bottom left is the R console, if we run code from a script, it
runs in the console; many outputs also show up in the console, including
any printed output of code as well as errors and warnings. We can also
run code directly in the console. There is a second tab in the bottom
left labeled Terminal that lets us run code in the terminal for our
computer if needed as well.

In the top right, we have a few tabs that can be helpful. Environment
will show variables, data frames, lists, and other objects we create.
History shows the history of what has been run in the console. We'll
discuss the Build tab later, and you may not have a Git tab yet, but you
hopefully will by the end of the day.

In the bottom right, we have several other useful tools available to us.
Files allows us to navigate through directories, as well as open and
move files. Plots is where any plots we generate with the code we run
will show up. Packages lists all of the packages you have installed, as
well as their version numbers, and whether they are loaded in or not.
Help is where we can examine documentation for functions, as well as
some more general help tools available on the home page. Viewer and
Presentation we'll discuss later, they're for viewing documents and
slides we create as markdown or quarto files.

## Github

Github is a platform for developing software, and for our purposes,
allows us to do version control and collaboration remotely. What does
that mean? We'll use it to save our work remotely, keep track of
changes, and allow us to access our code from multiple computers if need
be.

If you don't have a github account, take a few moments to make one now.

## Setting Up an R Package Locally

First, we install some packages we'll need

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("roxygen2")
install.packages("usethis")
```

Then we load in devtools

```{r}
library(devtools)
library(usethis)
library(roxygen2)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
use_devtools()
```

And we'll use this to create a new package named epi204. You can name
the package something a bit different if you would like

```{r}
#| eval: false
create_package("~/path/to/epi204")
```

Notes:

-   Don't place the package inside another R package, another RStudio
    project, a different Git repo, or your R package library
-   Note that the package will be a directory (folder) with the name you
    give it here (e.g. epi_204), so you don't need to create a directory
    to place the package in.

A new R session should appear, opened to your new package. You can check
this in the top right corner, where you can switch between various
projects and packages you are working on.

## What's In an R Package

Here's an except from "R Packages", @wickham2023r, regarding a new
package they are creating named `regexcite`. We'll end up adding some
more directories to the package for some other file types.

> -   `.Rbuildignore` lists files that we need to have around but that
>     should not be included when building the R package from source. If
>     you aren't using RStudio,
>     [`create_package()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/create_package.html)
>     may not create this file (nor `.gitignore`) at first, since
>     there's no RStudio-related machinery that needs to be ignored.
>     However, you will likely develop the need for `.Rbuildignore` at
>     some point, regardless of what editor you are using. It is
>     discussed in more detail in [Section
>     3.3.1](https://r-pkgs.org/structure.html#sec-rbuildignore).
>
> -   `.Rproj.user`, if you have it, is a directory used internally by
>     RStudio.
>
> -   `.gitignore` anticipates Git usage and tells Git to ignore some
>     standard, behind-the-scenes files created by R and RStudio. Even
>     if you do not plan to use Git, this is harmless.
>
> -   `DESCRIPTION` provides metadata about your package. We edit this
>     shortly and [Chapter 9](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html)
>     covers the general topic of the `DESCRIPTION` file.
>
> -   `NAMESPACE` declares the functions your package exports for
>     external use and the external functions your package imports from
>     other packages. At this point, it is empty, except for a comment
>     declaring that this is a file you should not edit by hand.
>
> -   The `R/` directory is the "business end" of your package. It will
>     soon contain `.R` files with function definitions.
>
> -   `regexcite.Rproj` is the file that makes this directory an RStudio
>     Project. Even if you don't use RStudio, this file is harmless. Or
>     you can suppress its creation with
>     `create_package(..., rstudio = FALSE)`.

Note that some of these files that begin with `.` likely won't be
visible unless you click on the More section of the Files tab in the
Output pane.

## Set Up a Git Repository

Ever wish you could try something out in a bunch of your code without
being stuck with all those changes? Git is a tool for version control.
It lets us track changes we make to our code, make branching versions of
our package where we can try out new approaches without needing to make
a whole bunch of copies of files, and much more.

Click to the Terminal tab in the Console section of RStudio, enter:
`git version`

Most Macs come with git already installed. If there is a version, you
have git already. If not, let's get git.

Searching "Git Guides Github" should get you to the Git Guide Github
page at https://github.com/git-guides. From here just click on the
Install tab near the top and install the correct version for your OS.

Once `git version` returns an actual version number, run the following
to create a Git repository

```{r}
#| eval: false
use_git()
```

If this throws an error about a user.name not being found, that's okay,
we need to set a name for Git to know us by.

The easiest way to do this is to run the following:

```{r}
#| eval: false
use_git_config(user.name = "example name", user.email = "emailhere@example.com")
```

User.name is the name attached to the commits you make, often people use
their full name or something related to their name so others know who is
making commits. User.email should be an email account you use with your
github account.

Then we can run `use_git()` on the R console again to create our git
repository.

### Using Git/Github

Now that we have our git repository, it's time to connect this to
github. First, let's run the following:

```{r}
#| eval: false
git_sitrep()
```

This provides us with a lot of the information we need to help connect
our local git repository to github. We may see that the Personal Access
Token is missing, we need this to help us connect to our github account.
If we are logged into github in our preferred browser and we run the
following, it should take us to a window where we can create one (I'd
recommend setting it to expire after the class ends and putting
something in the notes section that states what computer/user this token
is for:

```{r}
#| eval: false
usethis::create_github_token()
```

Copy the token once it is created, you can't access it again so you'll
need to regenerate new PATs in the future after it expires. Then run the
following in the Console and paste in the PAT when it asks for it.

```{r}
#| eval: false
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

Now we'll rerun git_sitrep to see if the PAT is discovered.

If that worked, it's time to try running the following to create a
github page for our package:

```{r}
#| eval: false
use_github()
```

If this all worked, we should be able to see a new Git tab in the top
right pane (likely: Environment, History, Connects, Build, and now Git).
You may need to close and reopen R for this to take effect. When we want
to commit our changes (sort of like saving the current state of the
package), we can hit the commit button.

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202024-04-01%20at%209.15.05%20PM.png){width="6.7in"}

This will bring up a new page, where we can check the boxes next to the
files with changes we want to commit. We don't have to commit changes to
all files in a particular commit, and we don't want to commit things we
don't want to send to GitHub (this is where the `.gitignore` file is
useful). We also need to provide a message describing the changes
included in the commit, then we can hit the commit button.

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202024-04-01%20at%209.18.50%20PM.png)

Then we can press `Push` to send the commit to GitHub. There's a lot
more we can do with GitHub, but for our current purposes, this should
suffice.

## Adding some stuff to the package

### Quarto

From the menu bar use File\>New File\>Quarto Document. Name the file
something like: `hw0.qmd` or `test.qmd`.

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-28%20at%203.38.17%20PM.png)

If you're familiar with R markdown, think of Quarto as a version of that
with more tools at your disposal. You can use languages other than R in
Quarto and Quarto has many more output formats available.

#### Headers

The header might start like this:

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-30%20at%208.01.28%20PM.png){width="2.56in"}

And we might put something like this:

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-30%20at%208.10.40%20PM.png){width="3.09in"}

So what do these mean?

-   title: pretty self-explanatory, put it in quotes

-   author: We can put author or authors here

-   format: in the original format, you can specify an output formal
    such as html, pdf, revealjs (slides), etc

    -   However we have a few neat things we can do. By putting the
        format in another line, we can assign settings for the whole
        document. We can even list two outputs with completely different
        settings (above we do html and revealjs), then later decide
        which one we want to Render

-   toc: include an automatically-generated table of contents in the
    output document

-   number-section: add numbers to sections

-   slide-number: add numbers to the slides

-   slide-level: What level of header is used to break apart slides.

-   scrollable: makes it so individuals slides can be scrolled if there
    is more information in one section than would fit on a slide

#### The document

Quarto allows us to insert sections of code, code output, text,
mathematical notation, images, tables, and more into a document, making
it one way you can show your code, your results, and discuss your
answers all in one document. On a mac, you can add a code chunk with
`⌥⌘ I`, if the code generates output such as a plot or text it will
appear in the document.

Let's try to add a plot here:

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggthemes)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-Penguin-Plot-1
#| fig-cap: "This is an example of a caption for the Penguin Plot of Flipper Length and Body Mass by Species"
#| warning: false
#| message: false
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)",
    color = "Species", shape = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_colorblind()
```

Now let's look at how we generated the caption for our plot, we did not
use ggtitle() or labs() because we want Quarto to add the "Figure 1" for
us.

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-31%20at%209.18.35%20AM-01.png)

We can add some settings for the chunk by using #\| and then the setting
we want to change. `#| label:` creates a label for the code chunk, it's
helpful for keeping things organized on our side. `#| fig-cap` lets us
create a caption for the figure and fig-cap-location in our document
settings puts it above the figure. You can also put the caption below
the figure and add a title with `ggtitle()` or `labs(title = )`

```{r}
#| label: tbl-Penguin-Table-1
#| tbl-cap: "Here's an example table"
#| warning: false
#| message: false
head(penguins) %>% select(1:4) %>% pander::pander()
```

### Functions

Writing our own functions allows us to reduce how often we copy/paste
the same code.

```{r}
get_coefficients = function(df, formula){
  regression = 
    df %>% 
      lm(formula, data = .)
  coefs = regression$coefficients
  return(coefs)
}

get_coefficients(penguins, body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm)

```

Once we've written a function like this, we can make that function part
of our project by using:

```{r}
#| eval: false
use_r("get_coefficients")
```

Which opens a .R file with the name provided in the command. We can then
paste our function into this .R file

To create documentation for the function (the stuff that pops up when
you run ?functionname() ), you just need to place your cursor in the
function somewhere, then click Code \> Insert Roxygen Skeleton.

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202024-04-01%20at%205.14.53%20PM-04.png){width="4in"}

Details on Roxygen and function documentation can be found in Chapter 16
of 'R Packages' by @wickham2023r.

Once you've created a function and set up the Roxygen skeleton, you can
use `document()` to create and update the documentation as well as load
your functions again. Similarly, `load_all` can be used to load your
functions after any changes have been made without remaking the
documentation.

### Mathematical Notation

Mathematical Notation can be added in line using single dollar signs
around the math you wish to add written in LaTeX. For instance $\pi r^2$
is written as `$\pi r^2$`. To write mathematical notation in a separate
line, use double dollar signs around each:

$$
\ell = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\log{p(l_i,r_i|t_i)}}
$$ is just:

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202024-04-01%20at%208.41.49%20PM.png){fig-alt="$$ \\ell = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\log{p(l_i,r_i|t_i)}} $$"
width="3.84in"}

[Here](https://www.cmor-faculty.rice.edu/~heinken/latex/symbols.pdf) is
a helpful guide to how to write a lot of different things you might need
in LaTeX.
