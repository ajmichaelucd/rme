#### Count variable

A **count variable** is a random variable whose possible values are some subset of the non-negative integers; that is, a random variable $X$ such that:

$$\Range{X} \in \Nat$$

:::{#def-exposure}

#### Exposure

In many count outcomes, there is some sense of **exposure magnitude** or 
**duration of observation**: 

- number of individuals exposed
- time at risk
- length of toothbrushing session
- miles driven
- hours driven
- size of pond

This concept is similar to the number of trials in a binomial distribution,
except that **in non-binomial count outcomes, there can be more than one event per trial**.

We can use $t$ to represent continuous-valued exposures/observation durations, 
and $n$ to represent discrete-valued exposures.
