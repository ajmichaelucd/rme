#### Count variable

A **count variable** is a random variable whose possible values are some subset of the non-negative integers; that is, a random variable $X$ such that:

$$\Range{X} \in \Nat$$

#### Exposure magnitude

##### Exposure magnitude

:::: notes
For many count outcomes, 
there is some sense of 
**exposure magnitude**,
**population size**,  or 
**duration of observation** (@tbl-exposure-units).
::::

:::

outcome                      | exposure units
-----------------------------| -------------
infectious disease incidence | number of individuals exposed, time at risk
car accidents                | miles driven
worksite accidents           | person-hours worked
population size              | size of habitat

: Examples of exposure units {#tbl-exposure-units}

:::: notes
Exposure units are similar to 
the number of trials in a binomial distribution,
but **in non-binomial count outcomes, there can be more than one event per unit of exposure**.

We can use $t$ to represent continuous-valued exposures/observation durations, 
and $n$ to represent discrete-valued exposures.

::: {#def-event-rate}
#### Event rate

:::: notes
When the concept of an exposure magnitude is meaningful, 
the mean of the outcome $Y$ is typically modeled as an **event rate** 
(denoted $\lambda$) times the exposure magnitude ($t$). 
That is:
::::

$$\Expp[Y|T=t] \defeq \mu = \lambda \cdot t$$

$$\lambda \defeq \frac{\mu}{t}$$ {#eq-def-event-rate}

:::

---

::: {#thm-non-exposed}
When the exposure magnitude is 0, there is no opportunity for events to occur:

$$\Expp[Y|T=0] = 0$$
:::

--- 

::: proof
$$\Expp[Y|T=0] = \lambda \cdot 0 = 0$$
