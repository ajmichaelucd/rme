I have drawn these materials from many sources, including but not limited to:

- David Rocke's materials from the [2021 edition of Epi 204](https://dmrocke.ucdavis.edu/Class/EPI204-Spring-2021/EPI204-Spring-2021.html)

- *Regression methods in biostatistics: linear, logistic, survival, and repeated measures models*, 2nd edition [@vittinghoff2012regression]
