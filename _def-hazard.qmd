### Hazard function

The hazard function for a random variable $T$ at value $t$ is the conditional density of $T$ at $t$, given $T\ge t$; that is:

$$h(t) \eqdef p(T=t|T\ge t)$$

If $T$ represents the time at which an event occurs, then $h(t)$ is the probability that the event occurs at time $t$, given that it has
not occurred prior to time $t$.
